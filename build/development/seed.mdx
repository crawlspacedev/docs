The seed function instructs the crawler where to start crawling.
It returns an array of strings and/or [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) objects.
The seed function can be asynchronous, if you want to fetch URLs from an external source.

```typescript
async seed() {
  // const response = await fetch(...);
  return ["https://news.ycombinator.com"];
}
```
