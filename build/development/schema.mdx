The schema of a crawler on Crawlspace is defined as a [Zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod) object.
It's responsible for setting column types and constraints for your crawler's sqlite table.
Return a Zod object in the `schema()` function to define your schema. Here's an example:

```typescript
schema({ z }) {
  return z.object({
    job_title: z.string(),
    is_remote: z.boolean(),
    salary_range: z.array(z.number()),
    url: z.string().describe('unique'),
  });
}
```

## Types

### String

```ts
z.string() // TEXT, like "Hello, world!"
```

### Enum

```ts
z.enum(["apple", "banana", "cucumber"]) // TEXT, like "banana"
```

### Number

```ts
z.number() // REAL, like 3.14
```

If you know your value will always be an integer, you can be more specific:

```ts
z.number().int() // INTEGER, like 17
```

### Boolean

SQLite doesn't support boolean types, so instead values get saved as either a `0` or a `1`.

```ts
z.boolean() // INTEGER CHECK (column IN (0, 1)), like 1
```

### Date

```ts
z.date() // DATETIME, like 2024-11-20 00:42:29
```

### Object

Unstructured objects can be saved as pure strings.
You'll be responsible for stringifying the object before inserting the row, and parsing the object after reading the row.

```ts
z.object() // TEXT, like "{\"foo\": \"bar\"}"
```

If your object is guaranteed to have a consistent shape,
it's recommended to flatten it so that each property gets its own column instead.

### Array

Like objects, arrays get saved as strings under the hood.
You'll need to `JSON.stringify()` before writing, and `JSON.parse()` after reading.
Pass in another Zod object as its parameter to specify the types of items inside the array.

```ts
z.array(z.number().int()) // TEXT, like "[1, 2, 3, 4]"
```



## Constraints

All columns are *nullable*, meaning they accept null values.
You cannot make a column require values (i.e. set a `NOT NULL` constraint).
Crawlspace enforces nullable columns to simplify migrations between deployments.

### Unique

If you'd like a column to have unique values, then append `.decribe('unique')` to your Zod object.
This is useful when upserting data to your table.
If you attempt to insert (not upsert) a duplicate value to a unique column, then the insertion will fail.

```ts
z.string().describe('unique') // unique values for each row
```

## Predefined columns

Each crawler's table already has a few predefined columns.
The Crawlspace platform maintains the values for these columns,
so you don't need to return them in your schema nor handler.

- `id` The auto-incrementing primary key.
- `message_id`: A hexadecimal value used to trace the datum's request.
- `url`: The URL of the request.
- `created_at`: When the row was created.
- `updated_at`: When the row was updated. Only relevant for upserts.
