title: Handler
description: Custom logic after every successful response
icon: code
---

The handler is the meat and potatoes of your crawler.
Here you write custom logic to do whatever you'd like!
Below is an example that scrapes data from a hypothetical job posting.

<Note>
Remember: by the time the handler runs, the request has already been made.
Use the handler to process the page's DOM rather than fetch new requests.

## Parameters

### HTML

#### `$`

```ts
$: (querySelector: string) => HTMLElement | null;
```

The `$` function is shorthand for `document.querySelector()`,
and is available when the response `content-type` starts with `text/html`.

#### `$$`

```ts
$$: (querySelector: string) => Array<Node>;
```

The `$$` function is short for `Array.from(document.querySelectorAll())`,
and is available when the response `content-type` starts with `text/html`.

#### `toMarkdown`

```ts
toMarkdown: (el: string | HTMLElement) => string;
```

#### `ai`

```ts
ai: {
  extract: <T>($el: HTMLElement | string) => Promise<T>;
  sentiment: ($el: HTMLElement | string) =>
    Promise<{ score?: number; label?: string }[]>;
  summarize: ($el: HTMLElement | string) =>
    Promise<{ summary: string }>;
  tool: ({
    name,
    description,
    schema,
  }: {
    name: string;
    description: string;
    schema: any;
  }) => {
    name: string;
    description: string;
    parameters: {
      type: string;
      properties: Record<string, { type: string; description: string }>;
      required: string[];
    };
  };
};
```

### JSON

#### `json`

```ts
json: unknown;
```

The `json` object is available when the response `content-type` starts with `application/json`.
Use this object instead of awaiting `response.json()`.

### `request`

```ts
request: Request;
```

With `request`, you have access to the properties of the request that had been made.

### `response`

```ts
response: Response;
```

With `response`, you have access to the properties of the response.
Use this object to read things like response headers.
If you want to parse JSON from the response's body, use [`json`](#json).


### `logger`

```ts
logger: Console;
```

Console statements get stripped out of the crawler bundle before deploying to Crawlspace.
To retain console messages, use `logger` as a replacement for `console`.

### `z`

```ts
z: ZodObject;
```

Zod global, for convenience.


## Returned properties



### `insert`

```ts
insert?: any;
```

### `upsert`

### `onConflict`
*string*

### `enqueue`

```ts
enqueue?: Array<string | Request>;
```
