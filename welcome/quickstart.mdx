This quickstart assumes that you already have a Crawlspace account.

[Sign up](https://crawlspace.dev/) if you haven't already &mdash; it's free to create a new account.

<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <Step title="Install the CLI">

    Install [@crawlspace/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@crawlspace/cli)
    globally to use the CLI from any directory.

    ```bash
    npm i @crawlspace/cli -g
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Log in to the CLI">

    Enter the same email address you used when signing up.
    A one-time passcode will be sent to this address &mdash;
    paste it into the CLI when prompted to verify your identity.

    ```bash
    crsp login
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new crawler">

    The `crsp new` command generates a template inside the directory of your choosing.
    Edit the generated files to customize your crawler's behavior.
    Read [Build a web crawler](/build/overview) to learn the basic syntax.

    ```bash
    crsp new
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your crawler">

   Test out your crawler locally with the `crsp dev` command.
   This emulates your crawler's behavior locally.
   Certain features like JavaScript rendering are unavailable in this mode.
   Keep in mind that the speed will be much slower compared to running in production.

    ```bash
    crsp dev
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy your crawler">

    That's it! Note that you must have an active subscription before your crawler can start.

    ```bash
    crsp deploy
    ```

  </Step>
