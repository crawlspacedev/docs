This quickstart assumes that you already have a Crawlspace account.

[Sign up](https://crawlspace.dev/) if you haven't already &mdash; it's free!

<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <Step title="Install the CLI">

    Install [@crawlspace/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@crawlspace/cli)
    globally to use the CLI from any directory.

    ```bash
    npm i @crawlspace/cli -g
    ```

  <Step title="Log in to the CLI">

    Enter the same email address you used when signing up.
    A one-time passcode will be sent to this address &mdash;
    paste it into the CLI when prompted to verify your identity.

    ```bash
    crsp login
    ```

  <Step title="Create a new crawler">

    The `crsp new` command generates a template inside the
    directory of your choosing. Edit the generated files to customize your
    crawler's behavior.

    ```bash
    crsp new
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy your crawler">

    That's it!
